# Multi-label-Traffic-Image-Classification
Develop predictive models that can determine, given an image, which one of 14 classes it is.

Traffic congestion seems to be at an all-time high. Machine Learning methods must be developed to help solve traffic problems. In this assignment, I will analyze features extracted from tiny traffic images depicting different traffic-related objects to determine their type as one of 14 classes, noted by integers 1-14: car, suv, small_truck, medium_truck, large_truck, pedestrian, bus, van, people, bicycle, and motorcycle, signal_green, signal_yellow, signal_red. The object classes are heavily imbalanced. For example, the training data contains 31,775 cars but only 280 motorcycles and 197 buses. Classes in the test data are similarly distributed.

The input to your classifiers will not be the images themselves, but rather features extracted from the images. I am going to build a vector representation of the images and then experiment with using classification algorithms to achieve the best classification performance. (A few classic examples of image features are Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features, Normalized Color Histogram (Hist) features, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features, Color gradient (RGB) features, Depth of Field (DF) features, etc.)
